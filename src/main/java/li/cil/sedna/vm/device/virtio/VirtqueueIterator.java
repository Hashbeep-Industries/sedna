/**
 * Provides a way of iterating over in virtqueues and obtain their available descriptor chains.
 * <p>
 * Virtqueues work by the driver providing descriptor chains where each descriptor in a chain
 * can either be read-only or write-only. This iterator wraps this through the {@link DescriptorChain}
 * interface which virtually concatenates all descriptors in a chain that are of the same type.
 * Depending on whether the chain contains only read-only descriptors, only write-only descriptors,
 * or some read-only descriptors followed by some write-only descriptors the {@link DescriptorChain}
 * will be readable, writable or writable after readable, respectively.
 * <p>
 * A chain where read-only descriptors follow after one or more write-only descriptors is
 * illegal. When this case is encountered the device will enter an error state and will need
 * a reset.
