/**
 * Represents a single descriptor chain in a virtqueue.
 * <p>
 * Instances of this type can be obtained from a {@link VirtqueueIterator} to read from
 * and write to the current descriptor chain of a virtqueue.
 * <p>
 * Descriptor chains where both {@link #readableBytes()} and {@link #writableBytes()} is
 * non-zero must have all their readable bytes processed first, before they can be written
 * to. In other words, {@link #put(byte)} and its batch versions will throw an
 * {@link IllegalStateException} while {@link #readableBytes()} is non-zero.
 * <p>
 * Descriptor chains become invalid once {@link #use()} has been called. Reading
 * from or writing to them afterwards will raise an {@link IllegalStateException}.
 * <p>
 * To write typed data to the descriptor chain it is recommended to use a {@link ByteBuffer}
 * which this data was written to. The data has to be written in little-endian mode.
 * For example:
 * <pre>{@code
 * ByteBuffer buffer = getTemporaryBufferSomehow();
 * buffer.order(ByteOrder.LITTLE_ENDIAN);
 * buffer.putShort(id);
 * buffer.putShort(arg);
 * buffer.putInt(magic);
 * buffer.flip(); // Make data just written readable in buffer.
 * DescriptorChain chain = getChainSomehow();
 * chain.put(buffer);
 * chain.use();
 * }</pre>
